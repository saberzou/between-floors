# Between Floors

**Micro-stories set in elevator encounters. Scroll to experience the journey.**

## Story 1: "Welcome Home"

Maya moves into The Confluence, a smart residential building 20 years in the future. The building AI, Aria, knows... too much.

**Genre:** Dark, surveillance anxiety, Black Mirror vibes  
**Floor:** Lobby (0) → Floor 9  
**Characters:** Maya (new resident) + Aria (building AI)

## The Concept

**Between Floors** is a collection of weekly micro-stories set in The Confluence, a 20-floor residential building in the year 2046. AI and robots are household norms. Stories range from dark to warm, funny to melancholic.

**Format:**
- Each story = one elevator ride
- Scroll down = elevator ascends/descends
- Text reveals as you scroll
- 80-100 words per story
- Modular (each story stands alone)
- Seasonal arc (52 stories = 1 year in the building)
